<h2><bold><em>Shadows</em></bold></h2>

<p>
Clothes hung from a single hanger on the wall,<br>
light from the side,<br>
long and elongated shadows;<br>
<select class="" name="">
<option value="">dark</option> 
<option value="">gray</option> 
<option value="">scary</option>
</select>
<br>
Like the intertwined branches of trees in the dense forest,<br>
ambiguous,<br>
like getting lost in the fog.<br>
I was afraid of shadows,<br>
I did not know the story of the shadows.<br>
I was lying on the bed,<br>
the clothes were very close to me,<br>
hat,<br>
coat,<br>
pants.<br>
I did not see their color,<br>
but their long shadows.<br>
Shadows that are bent in the corner of the room,<br>
they lean towards me,<br>
and I run away from them.<br>
I pull the blanket over my head,<br>
so I do not see them.<br>
Maybe because I do not know the reality of shadows;
<blockquote>People are afraid of the unknown,</blockquote>
like shadows.<br>
One of them shakes,<br>
all shadows move from the movement of a garment,<br>
the vibrancy of the shadows makes them even stranger.<br>
I made up a story in my mind,<br>
maybe I can look at them.<br>
The shadows become a father with his daughters,<br>
a dog with its owner,<br>
but I'm still under the blanket,<br>
and the <strong><q>shadows</q></strong>are there too.<br>

<h2><bold><em>Mother</em></bold></h2>

<p>
The sound of water can be heard from the kitchen,<br>
my mother's floral dress with her movements,<br>
goes left and then right.<br>
Opens the door,<br>
puts the blue cloth she was holding in the kitchen,<br>
and takes a paddle, to shovel the snow.<br>
On trees; on the ground, on the pots,<br>
everywhere is full of snow. <br>
The sound of the door opening is heard again,<br>
Done,<br>
There is no more snow in the yard.<br>
I do not know whether everyone has smelled the cold or not;<br>
but my mother's clothes smell cold,<br>
even the scarf she wears on her head.<br>
Sits by the heater,<br>
puts teacup on the carpet,<br>
and calls me.<br>
My mother looks at me with eyes full of stories,<br>
I hold her hands in my hands.<br>
She speaks in a calm voice,<br>
I say, tell me again from your youth,<br>
she tells the stories,<br>
and I think;
<blockquote>How relationships are formed?</blockquote>
How do humans become interdependent?<br>
Why some relationships are valuable to us, but some of them not?<br>
Does a human being have any meaning without a relationship?<br>
My mother picks up the cup,<br>
she drinks a sip of tea,<br>
she opens her colored scarf,<br>
lies down,<br>
and I am enchanted by my <b><cite><q>mother</q></cite></b> 's stories.<br>

<h2><bold><em>Morning</em></bold></h2>

<p>
    It is morning,<br>
    the sun slowly spreads its light everywhere.<br>
    the woman next door sends her son to school,<br>
    the volume of cars on the streets is increasing,<br>
    the sidewalks are full of people,<br>
    passengers are waiting at the bus stop,<br>
    with the arrival of the bus, the station becomes empty of people.<br>
    an old man is sitting on the swing,<br>
    he has closed his eyes,<br>
    there are no children in the park,<br>
    it is as if they all go to school in the morning.<br>
    A loud voice is heard,<br>
    two cars collide,<br>
    the drivers get off,<br>
    they fight with each other.
    <blockquote>Nobody pays attention to the morning,</blockquote>
    Mornings come and go,<br>
    and people think that another morning is waiting for them.<br>
    They ignore the mornings.<br>
    A little further,<br>
    the old man in the park,<br>
    talks to the morning.<br>
    He is the only one who has embraced the morning,<br>
    It is <strong><q>morning</q></strong>.<br>
