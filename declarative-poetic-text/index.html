  fulfilled Wishes
</h2>


<div class="main">
 <p id="myP">
   sit down and listen to me,
   I want to tell you about my Wishes
   the ones I dreamed of one day and
   I am raising them in my hands now.
   fulfilled Wishes should not be so Discomfortable
   You have to be happy to reach them
   it should be celebrated.
   for all the efforts made
   must be respected.
   but now I am in the midst of these Wishes
   I'm Lost â€¦
   sit by the window covered with flowers
   and listen to me.
   You should not try for every Wish
   sometimes it's better
   a Wish
   remain a <span class="wish">Wish</span>.
