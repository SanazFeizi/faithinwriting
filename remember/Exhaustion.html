    <h3>Exhaustion</h3>
    <br>
    <h2>The cozy corner </h2>
    
    <p>
        Nine pots with amazing plants,<br>
        the pots are placed close to each other,<br>
        one, on top of a small tea table; another next to it;<br>
        above the fireplace; there are three other pots on the gray stone ledge, with yellow light from small lamps shining on them. <br>
        Most pots are white,<br>
        some of them are tall, others are big and wide;<br>
        there is small pots as well,<br>
        but all are made from ceramic.<br>
        They have subtle designs of their own color;<br>
        the whiteness of the pots harmonizes with the white stones of the wall next to the fireplace,<br>
        and contrasting with gray stone above the fireplace and inside it.<br>
        A beautiful color combination comprised of white, gray, and green, mixed with pale yellow light.<br>
        Plants that some have grown to near the ceiling,<br>
        and some have their branches hang down towards the ground.<br>
        The brown color of the table can hardly be seen through the greenery of the plants.<br>
        Sometimes the white silk curtain joins the pots beacuse of wind blowing,<br>
        and touches the delicate leaves of plants.
    </p>
   
    <p>
        I like this corner more in the mornings,<br>
        when the small yellow lights are off,<br>
        and the sun, spread its light through the window over plants and even a little further on the carpet.<br>
        At the same time of the day; with a small purple cleaning cloth,<br>
        I dust the leaves of the plants, one after the other,<br>
        then I water the flowers with a small pink watering can, which my sister bought for me.<br>
        Sometimes water slips from a leaf and falls to the ground,<br>
        the white stone with very thin orange lines gets wet under my feet.<br>
        The smell of soil fills the whole space,<br>
        and the sound of boiling water in a kettle.
    </p> 

    <p>
        I sit on the sofa next to the plants, which is also green,<br>
        I lean on its yellow cushion,<br>
        and I look at my own sketches that are hidden among a large number of colored pencils,<br>
        and those fragile branches of plants that I put them in bottles of water,<br>  
        once upon a time they were soda bottles; but now they are home to my plants.
    </p>

    <p>
        I will always love that corner,<br>
        even when I'm too far away,<br>
        even when my pots are guests of other houses,<br>
        even if I never see it again.<br>
