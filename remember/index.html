        I remember the day that it was the first day of my school, 
        there were many things that I did not know anything about them,
        like five months ago that it was my first day in the states.
        <br>
        <br>
        I remeber the book store which was full of books,
        as if they were talking to me, and the old man.
        <br>
        <br>
        I remember the flames on that cold night.
        <br>
        <br>
        I remeber puting the first flower pot by the window.

        The day that it was the first day of my school, 
        there were many things that I did not know anything about them,
        like five months ago that it was my first day in the states. Maybe the book store which was full of books,
        as if they were talking to me, and the old man, will help me to go through this or the flames on that cold night
        or the old man himself. Puting the first flower pot by the window, was the first sign of hope.
