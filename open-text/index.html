         Was standing; tired, worried, and anxious. A strange noise in the streets;  in the alleys, 
         turns slowly, looks at the sky.<br>
         A girl calls out, can you buy chewing gum? This sentence is familiar.<br>
         Thinks; how life has shaped this path for him that now he has to disappoint this small vendor.<br> 
         Goes;<br> 
         with the sound of his footsteps; the child's voice repeats in his mind.

         An attempt that did not yield result; like endless paths, unfulfilled desires, 
         constant deadly repetitions.<br>
         How life has shaped this path for him!<br>
         On the half-dead damp bench, from the rain an hour ago, he leaves his tired body,<br>
         leaves on the ground; yellow, red, orange;<br>
         it's as if the rainbow is on the ground instead of the sky, he laughs,<br> 
         he laughs out loud by himself alone..he laughs and laughs ... <br>
         He frowns again, he thinks again .. the world is so big, apparently not for everyone,<br>
         sometimes a little girl selling chewing gum is a burden on the world shoulders, 
         sometimes his own wishes,<br>
         keeps on going,<br>
         counts,<br>
         there are many,<br>
         cracked paving under his feet.<br>
         Walks faster; as if someone is waiting for him,<br>
         but he is careful not to step on the cracks in the pavement.<br>
         The sound is still repeated in his ears;<br>
         he distracts himself by counting trees;<br>
         there are many;<br>
         sees a withered tree; with long branches, a stout trunk; but dry and leafless,<br>
         with the arrival of spring, this tree will not turn green.<br>
         like himself, and that little girl.<br>
         Stands for a moment; closes his eyes,<br>
         sees that little girl playing with a doll within the trees, hears

             To myself I proposed the paragraph as a unit representing a single 
             moment of time, a single moment in the mind, its content all the 
             thoughts, thought particles, impressions, impulses—all the diverse, 
             particular, and contradictory elements—that are included in an 
             active and emotional mind at any given instant. For the moment, for
             the writer, the poem is a mind.(Page: 6)
