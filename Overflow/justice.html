            a long narrow corridor
            has gone up and down many times
            there is a tall window at the end of it
            its amorphous black bars
            protect desperate people from jumping
            they call 
            takes a step
            slow 
            feeble
            hopeless
            has entered this room many times
            maybe ten times
            light wooden benches in a row
            sits on the first bench in front of them
            look down
            they ask a number of questions
            there is nothing to investigate
            leaves the room
            puts the stamped sheet among several other ones 
            with the same stamp
            goes to the end of the corridor
