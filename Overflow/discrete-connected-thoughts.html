     I hear rumble through the various streets of the city women on the street in small and large groups
     while holding placards they walk their fists are facing the sky they are in search of <a id="justice" href="justice.html">justice</a>
     they have flooded the streets they shout expect others to think expect authorities to enact fair rules
     making <a id="society" href="society.html">society</a> free of superiority <a id="gender" href="gender.html">gender</a> color race a woman walks ahead of everyone says sentences out loud 
     she repeats without being in harmony with others I am a human being in search of equality demanding <a id="freedom" href="freedom.html">freedom </a>
     freedom of speech freedom of choice in a building overlooking the street I am by the window
     through smoky stained glass I see girls and <a id="women" href="women.html">women</a> each claimant has lost an inalienable right the right to live in peace
     to reproduce to do abortion to be seen to be woman to be human I am sitting I had a cup in my hand full of tea
     it is cold now I put the cup on the table I think of women of girls have been cruelly burned in the fire of violence
     of a mother who fought for equality and the result was nothing but inequality of families who under the name of
     culture tradition morals value become the killers of soul and body behind this smokey window I bear the pain of all women
     I am screaming too life is my right I am a <a id="human" href="human.html">human</a> I am a woman I am equal with you
