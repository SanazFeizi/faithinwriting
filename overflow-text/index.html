         words are arranged side by side
         one obscure sentence after another
         constant flipping
         going back and forth
         a loud voice reads words
         sometimes spells
         sometimes does not read a word
         sometimes repeats a word for hours
         sentences  as well
         sometimes stops
         does not read
         does not repeat
         sometimes just looks
         too MUCH words
         which should not be read
         which should not be repeated
         maybe war
         maybe bullets
         maybe woman
         there are many 
         to overflow
         the last page
